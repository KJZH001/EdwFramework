# Xiaokong emptydream world PHP rapid development framework
A PHP framework that can help you develop PHP quickly

Notice:Because I cannot speak English well,this Page is translate by Machine(Baidu Translate).I am sorry for that.
## A brief introduction
A rapid development framework based on PHP

Because the front end forces no other framework, there is no need to worry about compatibility

Global pseudo static, built-in parsing module, let's go to hell with virtual hosts that don't have custom directories 2333

Greetings from the author: This is the first big project I wrote in PHP. Maybe it's bad. I hope you don't spray QAQ
## Features of the framework

1. Global pseudo static, with parsing module

2. CMS + modular design, with good scalability

3. Plug in interface is built in advance for later development

4. Prefabricated database module and login registration, open interface, easy to call

5. Built in mdui Official theme (built-in mdui framework), built-in basic site content, ready to use

6. Built in visual background management (not completed yet), graphical background is the essence!

7. I haven't thought about it yet

## Deployment steps

Download the latest full release of this framework and upload it to any directory of your server

Complete the server resolution (although the framework has considered the subdirectory at the beginning, please use the root directory as much as possible), and then import the data of the provided database

Modify global/ global.php  Configuration content in (other subordinate programs may also need to be modified global.php For normal operation)

At this point, you should be able to make the framework work smoothly

## Use in production environment

After completing the deployment steps, you should configure the permissions

To ensure that the front end cannot directly access the / website / and / system / directories of the back end to ensure the security of the program

Finally, the framework is still in the development phase, and we cannot guarantee that there will be no accidents at runtime

## Open source / reference projects used

## Finally

Because this framework uses a lot of open source projects and other big guy's code, I have learned a lot from it. In other words, this framework is jointly maintained by a large number of open source community contributors (maybe you are one of them). Thank these developers for providing open source code here
